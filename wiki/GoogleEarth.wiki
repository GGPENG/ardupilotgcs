= Installing and Configuring Google Earth =

  * Download Google Earth from [http://earth.google.com/intl/en/download-earth.html here]. 
    Currently _Ground Control Station_ only supports Windows operating system, so download  Windows version of GE.
  * Follow installation prompts, and when finished, start Google Earth application


==Configuring Google Earth==

Although it is possible to run Google Earth with default settings,  few changes are recommended but not absolute necessary

  # *Navigation Controls* - Turn off navigation controls by going to _View > Show Navigation_ and select _Never_.  Because GCS uses custom file to display kml data, Google Earth's navigation controls will not work, so leaving them displayed might cause confusion.

  # *Layers* - It's suggested to un-check all ( most) of the layer overlays in order not to have unceseery communication traffic and slow down UAV display. By doing this Google Earth will not attempt to communicate with the server and update live traffic, or historical places, etc.
