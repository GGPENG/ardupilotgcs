= Installing and Configuring Google Earth =

  * Download Google Earth from [http://earth.google.com/intl/en/download-earth.html here]. 
    Currently _Ground Control Station_ only supports Windows operating system, so download  Windows version of GE.
  * Follow installation prompts, and when finished, start Google Earth application


*Configuring Google Earth*

Although it is possible to run Google Earth with default settings,  few changes are recommended but not absolute necessary.

  # Navigation Controls - Turn off navigation controls by going to _View > Show Navigation_ and select _Never_.  Because GCS uses custom file to display kml data, Google Earth's navigation controls will not work, so leaving them displayed might cause confusion.
