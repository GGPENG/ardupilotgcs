= Logging =


During flight two log files are created
  * data log file - containing navigation and attitude data
  * kml log file - containing data about flight path and waypoints

For both files, all data is logged as is received. During the flight kml file will be called APflight.kml, however after GCS exits, it will be renamed "APflight_year_month_day_hour_minute_sec.kml" . For example "APflight_2010_05_07_23_29_47.kml" was created on May 7th, 2010 at 11:29:47 pm.
Same file naming scheme goes for data log file - "ArduPilot_DataLog_2010_05_07_23_28_54.txt".
