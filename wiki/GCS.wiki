Make sure that you installed and configured hardware per [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot/wiki/IntroductionPage ArduPilot Instructions]. 
Don't power-up ArduPilot yet.

Choose _COM Port_ and _Baud Rate_ ( red arrows ) where ArduPilot will connect to. Press _Connect_ ( although ArduPilot is not powered-up GCS will "listen and wait" on that port for it).  Note that _Boaud Rate_ has helpful hints dor identifications of EM 406 and uBlox GPS-es. Also next time you start GCS it will "remember" these settings and automatically connect to them. If your ArduPilot settings changed, just set them again on this screen
